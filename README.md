# Atlantic_DataAnalysis
This file includes queries and rudimentary modeling in R for a sample Atlantic Dataset

In the files "Redshift" and "Superset-SQL", you will find code related to the following

1.) ingesting, cleaning, and formatting of data 

2.) All Exploratory plots + query in Superset, where I attempt to plot everything out and see what the data looks like . 

In the file 'Rmarkdown', you will find a rudimentary Logistic Regression on the likelihood of a user returning the very next day. 

1.) For ease of replication, copy and paste it into an empty Rmarkdown file & change the file path to match your local machine.
