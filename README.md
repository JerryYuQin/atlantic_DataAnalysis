# Atlantic_DataAnalysis
This file includes queries and rudimentary modeling in R for a sample Atlantic Dataset

In the document "Redshift & SQL", you will find code related 
1.) ingesting, cleaning, and formatting of data
2.) All Exploratory plots + query in Superset, where I attempt to plot everything out and see what the data looks like
